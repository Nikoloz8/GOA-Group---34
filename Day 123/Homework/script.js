// 5. Create a function that returns a Promise which rejects after 2 seconds with an error message "Task 3 failed". Handle the rejection with a .catch to log the error message.

// 6. Create a function that returns a Promise which resolves after a random delay between 1 and 5 seconds with the message "Task 1 complete".

// 7. Create a function that returns a Promise which resolves after a random delay between 1 and 3 seconds with the message "First". Chain another .then that waits for another random delay between 1 and 3 seconds before logging "Second".

// 8. Create a function that returns a Promise which rejects after a random delay between 1 and 4 seconds with an error message "Task 3 failed". Handle the rejection with a .catch to log the error message.

// 9. Create a function that returns a Promise which resolves after a random delay between 1 and 5 seconds with the message "Task 1 complete" if the random number is greater than 0.5, otherwise, it should resolve with the message "Task 1 was quick".

// 10. Create a function that returns a Promise which resolves after a random delay between 1 and 4 seconds. If the random number is less than 0.3, reject with an error message "Task 3 failed". Otherwise, resolve with the message "Task 3 complete". Handle the rejection with a .catch to log the error message.
