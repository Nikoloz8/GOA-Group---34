// 1. Create a simple Promise that resolves after 2 seconds with the message "Task 1 complete".

// 2. Create a Promise that rejects immediately with an error message "Task 2 failed". Handle the rejection using .catch.

// 3. Create a Promise that resolves with a number (e.g., 5). Chain a .then handler to double the number and return it, then chain another .then handler to log the doubled number.

// 4. Create a function that returns a Promise which resolves after 2 seconds with a message "First". Chain another then that waits 1 second before logging "Second".

// 5. Create a function that returns a Promise which rejects after 2 seconds with an error message "Task 3 failed". Handle the rejection with a .catch to log the error message.
